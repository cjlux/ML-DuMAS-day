# ML-DuMAS-day

Introduction to IA &amp; ML for the DuMAS department day, September 2023, 22.

- The directory `IA_ML_slides` contains the introduction slides to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) presented for the DuMAS department day.

- 3 notebooks are proposed in the `Notebooks` directory:

  - `00_Convolutif_NN.ipynb`: explains some fundamental aspects of Neural Networks (NN), Convolutional NN and supervised learning for images classification.

  - `01_Classify_micrographs.ipynb`: shows how to load and pre-process labeled micrographs images used to train a Convolutional Neureal Network (CNN) to classify the micropgraphs.

  - `02_Classify_micrographs_EarlyStopping.ipynb`: shows the influence of different "early stopping strategies" on the training of the CNN and the performances of the trained CNN.
